- Open Spaces: creating discussion
  - Post-its, merging similar sessions, moving sessions around
  - Photgraph the board when you change it (when it settles down), post to "Board" on Slack (?)
  - Law of two feet
  - Law of two ears and one mouth
  - Invert your participation mode
  - It's OK to try any experiment via post-it. Like Julie's request for help on python.
  - Even if only one person shows up you'll have an experience. If no one shows up,
    you might have scheduled it against something that people really wanted to see,
    it doesn't mean your idea was bad.
