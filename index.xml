      <description>Organized by Bruce Eckel August 15-19, 2022 (Formerly The Java Posse Roundup)
NOTE: Many companies are still not supporting travel to conferences, so the event this Summer has become a developer retreat, which is a smaller and far less formal gathering. It does not have an entrance fee, because we will not be using the Parish Hall as we usually do. In addition, we will not be following the schedule on this site, but will organically be creating discussions, workshops to explore particular topics, and outdoor activities.</description>

      <description>Outdoor activities will be in the morning, sessions in the afternoon (when it often rains) Pre-conference: If you arrive early, post something on Slack. If I or others are around and available, we might be able to come out for meals or other activities.
Post-conference: Often people stay the day after the conference or for the weekend; informal gatherings have been known to happen.
Sunday 6:00pm Welcome Potluck Barbeque at Bruce&amp;rsquo;s House (107 WhiteRock).</description>
