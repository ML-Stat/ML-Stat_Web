      <description>Organized by Bruce Eckel August 15-19, 2022 (Formerly The Java Posse Roundup)
NOTE: Many companies are still not supporting travel to conferences, so the event this Summer has become a developer retreat, which is a smaller and far less formal gathering. It does not have an entrance fee, because we will not be using the Parish Hall as we usually do. In addition, we will not be following the schedule on this site, but will organically be creating discussions, workshops to explore particular topics, and outdoor activities.</description>

      <description>Outdoor activities will be in the morning, sessions in the afternoon (when it often rains) Pre-conference: If you arrive early, post something on Slack. If I or others are around and available, we might be able to come out for meals or other activities.
Post-conference: Often people stay the day after the conference or for the weekend; informal gatherings have been known to happen.

      <description>Open Spaces: creating discussion Post-its, merging similar sessions, moving sessions around Photgraph the board when you change it (when it settles down), post to &amp;ldquo;Board&amp;rdquo; on Slack (?) Law of two feet Law of two ears and one mouth Invert your participation mode It&amp;rsquo;s OK to try any experiment via post-it. Like Julie&amp;rsquo;s request for help on python. Even if only one person shows up you&amp;rsquo;ll have an experience. If no one shows up, you might have scheduled it against something that people really wanted to see, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean your idea was bad.</description>
